# (Don't) Open Your Eyes - Vita
Port of the PC game for PSVita (Ren'Py Port)

## An example of Ren'Py done as smoothly as possible
(Don't) Open Your Eyes" is a short, horror-themed Visual Novel about a midnight encounter with a mysterious being. Through conversation, you'll learn more about them, such as their journey so far, or what they think about themselves. And every now and then, it'll make a simple request out of you: to open your eyes.
It's up to you whether to open your eyes or not. It's up to you to believe if they're really there, or if that whispering voice is only a part of your imagination. Just don't keep your visitor waiting for too long.
